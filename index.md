## About Me

I am a third year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of
Michigan. I am advised by Professor [**Baris Kasikci**][baris-homepage].


In my research, I want to eliminate the intellectual barrier-to-entry for developers who want to use emerging hardware to develop efficient and reliable systems. To this end, I aim to create tools which developers can use to automatically reason about the characteristics of new hardware so that they can better leverage its capabilities without
sacrificing the correctness of their applications. My current focus is in the development of efficient and reliable
systems using emerging persistent main memory technologies. I am also interested in developing verifiably secure
hardware systems and tools which allow for easier development of secure systems.
