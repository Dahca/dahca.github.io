## About Me

I am a second year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of
Michigan. I am advised by [**Baris Kasikci**][baris-homepage].

I am interested in designing systems that better support prominent application
workloads and new hardware technologies. My main research interests are in
operating systems (how are new systems designed on emerging hardware
technologies), computer architecture (how can current systems design inform
future efficient hardware), and security (how can all of these new hardware
and software systems guarantee safety going forward). 

My latest work has been in developing storage systems for emerging persistent
storage technologies, such as non-volatile main memory (NVM). In my experience,
it is important to re-examine past assumptions about storage system design
for new storage devices and thoroughly analyze the performance characteristics
of the new medium to gain insights about how to best optimize for the platform.
