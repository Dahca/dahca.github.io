## Bio

I am a Computer Science and Electrical Engineering graduate from the University
of Texas at Austin.

My current goal is to pursue a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on
designing systems that better support prominent application workloads and new
hardware technologies. My main research interests are in operating systems (how
are new systems designed on emerging hardware technologies), computer
architecture (how can current systems design inform future efficient hardware),
and security (how can all of these new hardware and software systems guarantee
safety going forward). My most recent work has been on building novel and
efficient file systems.
