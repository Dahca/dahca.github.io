## About Me

I am a first year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of
Michigan. I am advised by [**Baris Kasikci**][baris-homepage].

I am interested in designing systems that better support prominent application
workloads and new hardware technologies. My main research interests are in
operating systems (how are new systems designed on emerging hardware
technologies), computer architecture (how can current systems design inform
future efficient hardware), and security (how can all of these new hardware
and software systems guarantee safety going forward). My most recent work
has been on building novel and efficient file systems.
