### Information
---
The Systems Reading Group (SRG) Student Seminar is a new, virtual talk series
which the [UMich CSE Systems Group](https://systems.engin.umich.edu/) is hosting Thursdays at [12:30 PM EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20210128T173000&p1=784).

This series is designed to give student researchers an opportunity to discuss their
exciting work with the broader systems community. We welcome anyone interested in computer systems research to attend. [**Please sign-up via this form**][google-form] if you are interested in attending or if you are a student interested in presenting! We plan to host all talks on Zoom, so registration
is required for viewing and participating in Q&A.


This series was inspired by [UW's system seminar course](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse590s/) and [UMass systems lunch](https://systems-lunch.org/).
