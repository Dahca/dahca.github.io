### EECS 582: Advanced Operating Systems (Winter 2022)

_While the course is titled "Advanced Operating Systems," the course is more broadly
about Computer Systems research: think OSDI, SOSP, ASPLOS, ATC, EuroSys-style work._

#### Description

In this course, we discuss advanced topics and research issues in operating systems and
more broadly in modern systems research.
Topics are drawn from a variety of classical and modern systems areas such as
kernel design, networking, security and protection, virtualization, heterogenous systems, and so on.

This course is a research-focused course. Students will work together in small
groups throughout the whole semester on a novel, high-impact research project under the direction
of course instructions, senior graduate students, or other accomplished researchers. Students
will also read, review, present, and discuss many seminal and award-winning systems research
papers during course meetings.

Students who take this course have a great opportunity to kick-start their research
careers and make a lasting impact outside the scope of a one-semester course: for example, I have
co-authored two papers ([Agamotto](/publications#neal2020agamotto), [NDA](/publications#weisse2019nda))
based on work done during the course of prior sections of EECS 582
(taught by [Baris Kasikci]({{ site.data.coauthors["Kasikci"].url }}/teaching));
other PhD students in the CSE department also have co-authored papers with EECS 582 students.
