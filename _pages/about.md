I am a PhD candidate studying Computer Science at the University of
Michigan. I am advised by Professor [**Baris Kasikci**][baris-homepage].

In my research, I want to eliminate the intellectual barrier-to-entry for 
developers who want to use emerging hardware to develop efficient and reliable 
systems. To this end, I aim to create tools which developers can use to 
automatically reason about the characteristics of new hardware so that they can 
better leverage its capabilities without sacrificing the correctness of their 
applications. My current focus is in the development of efficient and reliable
systems using emerging persistent main memory technologies.
