Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an R&D Engineer at [Veridise][veridise-homepage].

I received my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of
Michigan in the summer of 2023.
<!-- I am advised by Professor [**Baris Kasikci**][baris-homepage]. -->

In my research, I want to help developers write correct and efficient applications.
To this end, I aim to design tools that allow developers to automatically reason
about how their programs behave so that they can automatically find, reproduce, and repair bugs, thereby
helping developers spend less time fixing faults and more time innovating.
<!--My current focus is on automatically reproducing incidents from production systems
and on the automated detection of semantic bugs.-->
