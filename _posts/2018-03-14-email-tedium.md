## The Good

I just finished hearing back from all of the graduate programs I applied to.
Fortunately, I managed to get in to quite a few places (11 acceptances out
of 15 applications), all of which are quite good programs.

## The Bad

I can only go to one of these programs. (While the idea of 11 PhDs sounds
incredibly fancy, I don't think it would quite play out so well).

## The Dilemma

How do I decline an offer in such a way that won't cause the entire academic
community to ostracise me?

I've read quite a few pieces of advice<sup>[1][1] [2][2]</sup> on general "emails
in academia" advice and the original impression I was starting to get was that
I need to start putting a lot of thought into every single email and every single
type of email I sent, i.e. I needed to work on crafting my "question about a paper"
emails, my "declining to accept offer" emails, and so on.

I then had an epiphany as I was sitting down to write an email asking for advice
on how to write an email declining an offer. The opportunity cost for both myself
and the poor soul I was about to throw my worries at suddenly seemed way too high.

## The New Philosophy

- Read some advice! __But in moderation__.
- Try to develop your own style for emails. __And then consistently use that
  style.__

With this, I believe future emails will be appropriate -- and rather
importantly -- efficient.
